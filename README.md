# Mice_Protein_Expression

Expression levels of 77 proteins measured in the cerebral cortex of 8 classes of control and Down syndrome mice exposed to context fear conditioning, a task used to assess associative learning.

The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes.
